The steps taken to tidy the data are in the source code run_analysis.R. These steps include the following:
 1. Train and test datasets were merged
 2. Measurements on only the mean and standard deviation for each observation were extracted from the merged dataset.
 3. Activity names for the six activities (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying) were added to the merged dataset
 4. Two of the variables in the merged dataset were given descriptive names (Subject and Activity)
 5. The mean of each variable for each activity and each of the 30 subjects was calculated and a new table of these means was written out to the file 'data_mean.txt'

The variables in data_mean.txt are as follows

# Subject
Each of the 30 subjects was assigned an integer 1 through 30

# Activity
Measurements were obtained for these 6 Activites
* Walking
* Walking Upstairs
* Walking Downstairs
* Sitting
* Standing
* Laying

# Measurements
The means of the following 79 variables were calculated for each subject/activity pair.

The prefix 't' in these variables denotes time domain signals. Those measurements will have units of seconds.

The prefix 'f' in these variables denotes frequency domain signals. Those measurements will have units of Hz.
